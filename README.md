# About this repository

During my learning journey I came across freeCodeCamp learning platform where I'm going through different courses and certifications. In my first earned certification **Responsive Web Design** I went through 5 certification projects but I am not satisfied with their current state - I usually did the necessary minimum (with possibly some minor things on top) with the intention to get back to them once I'm done with the certification, however it is not possible to change them - that's  where this repository comes in. 

So the purpose of this repository is me going through those certification projects once again and doing them more properly this time using what I've learned.
